This project is a game of Tic Tac Toe 3x3. But you will never win because you are playing against computer D:
To play enter rows nad colomns of where you want to put 'X' (you are playing as 'X')
Please be careful - counting of rows and colomns starts at 0, not at 1! Therefore, if you want to place 'X' in the center, you should type 1 for rows and 1 for colomns.
